## 3D Solar Calculator

This project is an interactive 3D solar calculator built with **Three.js** and vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to visualize a solar energy system and calculate its performance based on the number of solar panels, batteries, and daily appliance usage.

### How It Works: Three.js and the Calculator

The application integrates a 3D visualization with a real-time calculation engine. The user interface controls the parameters for both the 3D scene and the energy calculation.

1.  **3D Scene (Three.js)**
    *   The file `script/main.js` initializes a Three.js scene inside the `<div id="scene-container">`.
    *   It is responsible for loading 3D models (like a house, solar panels, and batteries), setting up lighting, and creating the overall environment.
    *   The 3D scene dynamically updates based on user input. For example, changing the "Number of Solar Panels" input will add or remove corresponding 3D models from the scene, providing immediate visual feedback.

2.  **User Controls (HTML)**
    *   The `index.html` file defines the structure of the control panel.
    *   Users can specify the number of solar panels and batteries they have.
    *   They can also select which appliances they use daily and for how many hours.

3.  **Calculation Engine (JavaScript)**
    *   Event listeners in `script/main.js` monitor every change in the control panel inputs.
    *   When a value is changed, the calculator core logic is triggered:
        *   **Energy Generation**: It calculates the total power generated by the solar panels. Based on the UI, this is `(Number of Panels * 400W * 4 Peak Sun Hours)`.
        *   **Energy Consumption**: It calculates the total daily energy consumed by summing up the usage of all selected appliances: `(Appliance Power in kW * Hours of Use)`.
        *   **System Performance**: The logic compares total generation against total consumption to determine if the system is under-powered, sufficient, or over-powered.

4.  **Results and Feedback**
    *   The calculated performance is displayed in the "System Performance" area.
    *   A star rating (`#star-rating-display`) and a descriptive message (`#result-display`) provide a simple, easy-to-understand summary of how well the configured solar system meets the energy demands.

This tight integration between the UI, the calculation engine, and the Three.js visualization creates an engaging and informative user experience.

-------Step-by-Step Instructions converting obj to glb------

1. Launch Blender
- Open Blender and start a new project.

2. Delete the default cube
- Click the cube to select it.
- Press X → Confirm delete.

3. Import the .obj file
- Go to File > Import > Wavefront (.obj)
- Navigate to your .obj file and select it.
- Blender will automatically load the .mtl and textures if they’re in the same folder.

4. Check materials and textures
- Switch to Material Preview mode (top-right viewport sphere icon).
- Verify that colors and textures appear correctly.
- Optional: Use the Shader Editor to tweak materials if needed.

5. Apply transforms (recommended)
- Select the imported model.
- Press Ctrl+A → Apply:
- Location
- Rotation
- Scale

6. Export as .glb
- Go to File > Export > glTF 2.0 (.glb/.gltf)
- In the export panel (left side), set:
- Format: glTF Binary (.glb)
- Include: Selected Objects (if only exporting part of the scene)
- Transform: Enable +Y Up if needed for compatibility
- Geometry: Apply modifiers if used
- Materials: Export
- Textures: Choose Embed (for self-contained .glb) or Copy (for external textures)
- Choose your output filename and location
- Click Export glTF 2.0

✅ Final Checks
- Open the .glb in glTF Viewer to verify:
- Geometry
- Materials
- Textures
- Lighting and orientation
